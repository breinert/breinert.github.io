## How-to-Run

Open a terminal and navigate to the reactmap folder. Run `npm install` to install the npm dependencies and then run `npm install axios`, `npm install --save react-google-maps`, and `npm --save escape-string-regexp` to install the other dependencies. Then start the server with `npm start` and the website will launch in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. After reading the start modal click the begin button. You may then choose a location for biking from the seven locations on the Google Map with the bicycle map overlay. Clicking on a marker once will display the name. Clicking a second time will display five recommened coffee shopes in close proximity to the riding location. Clicking once will display the name of the store. Clicking a second time will display a picture, address, open status, and url link for the store. You may close that store and examine other stores using the same method. Clicking the reset button in the upper right will reset the app back to the biking location markers.

## Dependencies

The dependencies required can be installed using `npm install`. This project requires "axios" version "^0.18.0", "react" version "^16.7.0", "react-dom" version "^16.7.0", "react-google-maps" version "^9.4.5", "escape-string-regexp" version "^1.0.5", and "react-scripts" version "2.1.3". Google Maps Api and Foursquare API are also required for proper functioning.

## Contributing

 The code was written by Brian Reinert using `create-react-app` to create the starter code. In order to better understand React and assist with my problems I watched the walk-throughs and obtained dirrection in Slack from my fellow students and mentors at Udacity.
